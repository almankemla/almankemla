## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

University of California, Berkeley (M.S. Information and Cyber Security)
Georgia Institute of Technology (B.S. Computer Engineering, Cybersecurity concentration)

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a deep interest in securing digital systems and protecting information. My experience spans various areas, including reverse engineering, network security, and cloud security. I am particularly intrigued by the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity, as AI continues to shape the future of threat detection and defense strategies. The constant challenge of staying ahead of emerging threats, combined with the potential of AI, makes this an exciting area for exploration.

I enjoy tackling complex problems such as vulnerability analysis and secure hardware design, but Iâ€™m also eager to expand my knowledge in every aspect of the field. Being open to learning new technologies and methods, especially in AI and its applications in cybersecurity, is key to becoming a well-rounded security analyst. While I focus on areas like malware analysis and incidence response, I am enthusiastic about growing my skills across the entire cybersecurity landscape.
